## Tip Reaction

Receives the tip rate via Lightning Message Service (Tip.messageChannel-meta.xml) and displays a reaction:
* less than 13 percent = 'Oh, you have got to be kidding me!'
* greater/equal 13 percent and less/equal 19 percent = 'Surely you can do better than that...'
* greater than 19 percent = 'Thank you so much!'
